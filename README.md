Python Coding for Dungeons and Dragons
I am trying to learn Python coding. I am an avid Dungeon and Dragons player and will be trying to create some different codes to help create and play the game.
The pointsbuy.jpynb was built in JupyterLab. It is a straight one for one point buy to abilty score. i am working on adding a weighted buy that increases the points need to buy ability pionts as the get higher. i also would like to add in some racial bonuses and minuses so users can compare the different results based on what race the character takes on. Eventually, I want to add classes for full character development.
